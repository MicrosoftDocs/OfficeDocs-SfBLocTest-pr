# Office 365 Phone System voicemail (container topic - do not publish)

Start with an empathetic introduction that matches the customer's emotional state. Clearly state the intent, and acknowledge any pain pointsÂ—why they're searching for help. Then give them the quick answer or show them the steps.
  
    
    


## First level heading

This sentence introduces a procedure.
  
    
    
 **Procedure title (can be blank)**
  
    
    

1. Add steps for the procedure that best satisfies the main intent.
    
  
2. Add a step by placing cursor before the **/step** tag, then press Enter.
    
    Add an indented paragraph under a numbered step by placing cursor before the **/para** tag, then press Enter.
    
  
3. Turn the numbered steps into a bulleted list by placing cursor after the **steps** tag. In the Attribute Inspector, drop down the **class** list, then click **bullet**. 
    
  
This sentence introduces a bulleted list.
  
    
    

- List item 1.
    
  
- Add another list item by placing the cursor before the **/listItem** tag, then press Enter.
    
  
- Turn the bulleted list into a numbered list by placing cursor after the **list** tag. In the Attribute Inspector, drop down the **class** list, then click **ordered**. 
    
  
To create a table with a header, click **Table** > **Insert**.

Here's a "tip" alert.
  
    
    

> [!TIP]
> Customers like tips. When you have a good tip to share, include it. 
  
    
    


### Second level heading

To create a second-level heading, add a **sections** tag after the **/content** tag of the parent section, and then add a **section** tag into this **sections** tag.
  
    
    
To add another heading level of the same level, add a **section** after the last **/section** tag.
  
    
    

## Want more fries with that?

Here you can add other ways to satisfy the intent (for 80% of the people, but not the long tail or edge cases).
  
    
    

1. Step 1.
    
  
2. Step 2.
    
  
Or you can add the nice-to-have additional steps. If those nice-to-have steps address separate intents, just link to the articles for those intents.
  
    
    
Or you can address the key, common gotchas that often block readers from success.
  
    
    
If you need to, you can add a table. But first, be sure all the information in the table fits the customer's intent.
