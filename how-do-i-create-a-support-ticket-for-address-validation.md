# How do I create a support ticket for address validation?

Address validation is an important part of setting up Calling Plans in Office 365. It provides a user in your organization an emergency calling address that can be used by emergency response services.
  
    
    


## Create a service request to validate an emergency address


1. Sign in as an administrator to Office 365 with your work or school account.
    
  
2. In the Office 365 admin center, in the left nav click **Support** > **Service requests**. 
    
  
3. Under **Service requests** click **Add**.
    
  
4. On the **Create a service request** page, click **Online collaboration**.

  - **Feature** select **Domestic Calling Plan** and/or **International Plan**.

  - **Issue summary** enter **Address validation**.

  - Street number
    
  
  - Street name

  - Postal or zip code
    
  
6. Click **Next** page, click **Yes, continue** to continue.
    
  
7. On the **Add details** page, select and enter the following:
    
  - **Is your service unavailable?** select **No**.
    
  
  - **How many users are affected?** select **Some users**. 
    
  
  - **Enter an email address of someone affected by this issue** or leave blank.
    
  
  - **Select Domain (s) you want to list**
    
  
  - **Attach a file** if you have multiple addresses you need validated.
    
  
  - Click **Next**.
    
  
  - Enter your contact phone number.
