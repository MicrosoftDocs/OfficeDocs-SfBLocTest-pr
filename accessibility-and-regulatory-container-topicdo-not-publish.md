# Accessibility and regulatory (container topic - do not publish)

Start with an empathetic introduction that matches the customer's emotional state. Clearly state the intent, and acknowledge any pain pointsÂ—why they're searching for help. Then give them the quick answer or show them the steps.
  
    
    


## First level heading

This sentence introduces an ordered list that you can use to outline a procedure.
  
    
    
 **Procedure title (optional)**
  
    
    

1. Add steps for the procedure that best satisfies the main intent.
    
  
2. Add a step by placing cursor before the **/step** tag, then press Enter.
    
    Add an indented paragraph under a numbered step by placing cursor before the **/para** tag, then press Enter.
    
  
3. Turn the numbered steps into a bulleted list by placing cursor after the **steps** tag. In the Attribute Inspector, drop down the **class** list, then click **bullet**. 
    
  
This sentence introduces a bulleted list.
  
    
    

- List item 1.
    
  
- Add another list item by placing the cursor before the **/listItem** tag, then press Enter.

### Second level heading

To create a second-level heading, add a **sections** tag after the **/content** tag of the parent section, and then add a **section** tag into this **sections** tag.
  
    
    
To add another heading level of the same level, add a **section** after the last **/section** tag.
