# Customize meeting invitations

As an admin, you can ensure that all Skype Empresarial meeting invitations include some helpful information your users might need, such as links to your support web site and legal disclaimer, your company logo, and other text you want to include. 
  
    
    


## Tips for creating a logo for meeting invitations

1. Create an image that is no more than 188 pixels wide by 30 pixels tall (it's quite small).
    
  
2. Save the image in JPG format.
    
  
3. Store the image at a central location that everyone in your business can access, such as a network share, shared OneDrive for Business folder, Dropbox, etc.
    
    Now you can add it to your meeting invitations. See the next steps.
