# Configure presence privacy mode

The Skype Empresarial Online presence setting gives people more control over who can see whether they are available, in a meeting, or out of the office. For details about Skype Empresarial presence and privacy settings, see  [Controlar el acceso a la informaci√≥n de presencia en Skype Empresarial (Lync)](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/2fbfdcc5-d04b-49fe-ad90-264a42f7cce1%28Office.14%29.aspx).
