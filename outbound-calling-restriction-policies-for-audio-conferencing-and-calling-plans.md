# Outbound calling restriction policies for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans

Outbound call restriction policies are available for the following scenarios:
  
    
    


Audio Conferencing calls
  
    
    


End User calls
  
    
    


Both settings are controlled by a single policy called OnlineDialOut Policy which has a restriction attribute for each. The restriction settings possible within the policy are:
  
    
    


|||
|:-----|:-----|
|Setting  <br/> |Values  <br/> |
|Audio Conferencing Calls  <br/> |International and Domestic  <br/> Domestic  <br/> None  <br/> |
|End User Calls  <br/> |International and Domestic  <br/> Domestic  <br/> None  <br/> |
   

The policy cannot be customized, rather (what is the name we are calling Skype for Business/Teams Online Service???) has pre-defined policy instances for each combination of the settings. 
  
    
    


## Set calling restrictions for Audio Conferencing

These policies also be set via the Skype for Business Admin Center by doing the following steps:
  
    
    
Select "dial-in conferencing"
  
    
    
Select "dial-in users"
  
    
    
Select a user and click "edit"
  
    
    
Select the desired dial-out restriction on the "Restrictions to dial-outs from meetings of this user" option.
  
    
    
(Need to get updated screen shots to show both drop downs)
  
    
    

## Want to know more about setting these policies using Windows Powershell?

These policies can be viewed by the Get-CSOnlineDialOutPolicy commandlet and assigned to users by the Grant-CSOnlineDialOutPolicy commandlet. (Is there commandlet help for this policy yet? If so we should link it)
  
    
    
The following table gives an overview of each policy:
