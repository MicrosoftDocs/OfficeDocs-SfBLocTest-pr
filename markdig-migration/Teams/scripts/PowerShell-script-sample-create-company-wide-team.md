PowerShell Script Sample - Create a company-wide team in Microsoft Teams
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This PowerShell script creates a public, company-wide team in Teams. The script uses the MicrosoftTeams PowerShell module (currently in beta) to create a public, company-wide team. It also uses the AzureAD PowerShell module to fetch the list of users in your tenant. 

For complete instructions on using this PowerShell script, check out our tutorial, [Create a company-wide team in Teams using PowerShell](../Company-wide-team-creation-powershell.yml).

If you're new to PowerShell and need help getting started, see [Overview of Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/overview?view=azurermps-5.1.1).


## Sample script

> [!TIP]
> A PowerShell script file is a text file with a .PS1 extension. To use this script, click **Copy** and then paste the code into a text file. Save it with the filename CreateCompanyWideTeam.ps1, and you've got a PowerShell script.

<#
.SYNOPSIS
This script allows you to create a company-wide team.
.DESCRIPTION
Use this script with the MicrosoftTeams PowerShell version 0.9.0 beta module to create a team with members and channels that you specify. Also leverages the AzureAD module to find all members to add.
.PARAMETER Owners
The comma-separated list of owners for your Team, who handle team settings and membership management. The owners should be specified by their User Principal Name. You must specify a minimum of two owners.
.PARAMETER TeamName
The name of your company-wide team. For example, this could be your company name.
.PARAMETER TeamDescription
The description of your company-wide team, in quotes.
.PARAMETER Channels
The comma-separated list of names of all the initial channels you want to set up. For example: "Announcements","Social at Work","Teamwork at Contoso".
.PARAMETER GroupID
If you have already created the group for your company-wide team, specify its GroupID. You can get this value from the display of the “Get-AzureADGroup | Sort DisplayName | Select DisplayName,ObjectID” command. This script had an issue during the rest of the execution and stopped early. 
.PARAMETER Members
The comma-separated list of members for your team that you want to manually add. To use this script a minimum of two members must be added. The members should be specified by their User Principal Name. To manually just add a single member, use the “Add-TeamUser -GroupId $IdOfGroup -Role Member -User $member” command.

## Script explanation


For complete instructions on using this PowerShell script, check out our tutorial, [Create a company-wide team in Teams using PowerShell](../Company-wide-team-creation-powershell.yml)

There are 5 sections to this script (listed in order from top to bottom):
1. **Documentation and variable definitions**
2. **Function Create-Team**: Creates a team if necessary. If you don't specify a GroupID, this section will create the team with the specified TeamName and TeamDescription.
3. **Function Add-Channels**: If you've specified channels, this is where the channel description gets requested, and then the channel gets created. 
4. **Function Add-Members**: This does all member management. This section connects to AzureAD,  fetches a set of users, and adds them to the team if you don’t provide a member list. It handles the logic of adding owners and members, and not adding members who already belong to the team. 
5. **Main program**: This is the order in which the functions get executed.
