Turn on Microsoft Teams in your Office 365 organization
======================================================
> [!IMPORTANT]
> [!INCLUDE [new-teams-sfb-admin-center-notice](includes/new-teams-sfb-admin-center-notice.md)]

By default, Teams is turned on for all organizations. If you used Teams during the preview period, the setting stays the same as what you set during your Teams preview.


As an administrator for your organization, you can assign user licenses to control individual access to Teams, and you can allow or block what content sources can be used in Teams. See [Administrator settings for Microsoft Teams](https://support.office.com/article/3966a3f5-7e0f-4ea9-a402-41888f455ba2) for more information.

To learn more about managing individual licenses, read [Office 365 licensing for Microsoft Teams](Office-365-licensing.md).
