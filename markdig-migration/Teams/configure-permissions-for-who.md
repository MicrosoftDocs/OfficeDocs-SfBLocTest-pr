Configure permissions for Who
=============================

Users can use the Who app with Microsoft Teams to help them ask questions and find anyone in the organization based on what they're working on and who they work with.

To ensure users get the most out of Who, you must turn on the following member permissions in Microsoft Graph.

- Calendars.Read

- Calendars.Read.Shared

- Mail.Read

- MailboxSettings.ReadWrite

- People.Read

- People.Read.All

- Sites.Read.All

- User.Read.All
