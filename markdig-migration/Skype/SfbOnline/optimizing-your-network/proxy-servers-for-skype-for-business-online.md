# Proxy Servers for Skype for Business Online

This article will help you with guidance about using a proxy server with Skype for Business.
  
## Not using a proxy server is recommended

When it comes to Skype for Business traffic over proxies, Microsoft recommends bypassing proxies. Proxies don't make Skype for Business more secure because its traffic is already encrypted.
  
And having a proxy can cause issues. Performance-related problems can be introduced to the environment through latency and packet loss. Issues such as these will result in a negative experience in such Skype for Business scenarios as audio and video, where real-time streams are essential.
  
## If you need to use a proxy server

Some organizations have no option to bypass a proxy for Skype for Business traffic. If that's the case for you, the problems mentioned above need to be kept in mind.
  
Microsoft also strongly recommends:
