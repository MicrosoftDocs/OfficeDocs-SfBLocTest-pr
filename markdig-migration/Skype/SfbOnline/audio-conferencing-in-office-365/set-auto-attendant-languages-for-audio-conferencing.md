# Set auto attendant languages for Audio Conferencing

The Audio Conferencing auto attendant for Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams can greet audio callers in a number of different languages when they join a meeting.
  
Choose one primary language and up to four secondary languages. The primary language that you set will be used first and the secondary languages will be used by the auto-attendant in order that you select. 
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can configure the languages on domestic audio access phone numbers only.
