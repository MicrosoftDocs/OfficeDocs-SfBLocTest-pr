# Port and protocol requirements for servers
 
**Summary:** Review the port usage considerations before implementing Skype for Business Server 2015.
  
Skype for Business Server requires that specific ports on the external and internal firewalls be open. Additionally, if Internet Protocol security (IPsec) is deployed in your organization, IPsec must be disabled over the range of ports used for the delivery of audio, video, and panorama video. 
  
While this may seem a bit daunting at first, the heavy lifting for planning this can be done using the [Skype for Business Server 2015 Planning Tool](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=282725). Once you've gone through the wizard's questions about what features you plan to use, for each site you define you can view the Firewall Report within the Edge Admin Report, and use the information listed there to create yourfirewall rules. You can also make adjustments to many of the names and IP addresses used, for details see [Review the Firewall Report](../../management-tools/planning-tool/review-the-administrator-reports.md#Firewall_report). Keep in mind you can export the Edge Admin Report to an Excel spreadsheet, and the Firewall Report will be one of the worksheets in the file. 
  
You can also find the information in these tables in diagram form by reviewing the Protocol Workloads poster linked off of the [Technical diagrams for Skype for Business Server 2015](../../technical-diagrams.md) article.
> [!NOTE]
> - Skype for Business Online users should refer to [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2?ui=en-US&amp;amp;rs=en-US&amp;amp;ad=US). 
> - You can have hardware or software firewalls, we don't require specific models or versions. What matters is what ports are whitelisted so the firewall won't impair the functioning of Skype for Business Server.
  
## Port and Protocol Details

This section summarizes the ports and protocols used by servers, load balancers, and clients in a Skype for Business Server deployment.
  
> [!NOTE]
> When Skype for Business Server starts, it opens the required ports in the Windows Firewall. Windows Firewall should already be running in most normal applications, but if it is not being used Skype for Business Server will function without it. 
  
For details about firewall configuration for edge components, see [Edge Server scenarios in Skype for Business Server 2015](../../plan-your-deployment/edge-server-deployments/scenarios.md). 
  
The following table lists the ports that need to be open on each internal server role.

> [!NOTE]
> Some remote call control scenarios require a TCP connection between the Front End Server or Director and the PBX. Although Skype for Business Server no longer uses TCP port 5060, during remote call control deployment you create a trusted server configuration, which associates the RCC Line Server FQDN with the TCP port that the Front End Server or Director will use to connect to the PBX system. For details, see the **CsTrustedApplicationComputer** cmdlet in the Skype for Business Server Management Shell documentation.
  
For your pools that use only hardware load balancing (not DNS load balancing), the following table shows the ports that need to open the hardware load balancers.
  
**Hardware Load Balancer Ports if Using Only Hardware Load Balancing**

|**Load Balancer**|**Port**|**Protocol**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Front End Server load balancer  <br/> |5061  <br/> |TCP (TLS)  <br/> |
|Front End Server load balancer  <br/> |444  <br/> |HTTPS  <br/> |
|Front End Server load balancer  <br/> |135  <br/> |DCOM and remote procedure call (RPC)  <br/> |
|Front End Server load balancer  <br/> |80  <br/> |HTTP  <br/> |

Your Front End pools and Director pools that use DNS load balancing also must have a hardware load balancer deployed. The following table shows the ports that need to be open on these hardware load balancers.
  
**Hardware Load Balancer Ports if Using DNS Load Balancing**

|**Load Balancer**|**Port**|**Protocol**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|

|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Clients  <br/> |67/68  <br/> |DHCP  <br/> |Used by Skype for Business Server to find the Registrar FQDN (that is, if DNS SRV fails and manual settings are not configured).  <br/> |
|Clients  <br/> |443  <br/> |TCP (TLS)  <br/> |Used for client-to-server SIP traffic for external user access.  <br/> |
|Clients  <br/> |443  <br/> |TCP (PSOM/TLS)  <br/> |Used for external user access to web conferencing sessions.  <br/> |
|Clients  <br/> |443  <br/> |TCP (STUN/MSTURN)  <br/> |Used for external user access to A/V sessions and media (TCP)  <br/> |

|Clients  <br/> |1024-65535 \*  <br/> |TCP/UDP  <br/> |Video port range (minimum of 20 ports required).  <br/> |
|Clients  <br/> |1024-65535 \*  <br/> |TCP  <br/> |Peer-to-peer file transfer (for conferencing file transfer, clients use PSOM).  <br/> |
|Clients  <br/> |1024-65535 \*  <br/> |TCP  <br/> |Application sharing.  <br/> |
|Aastra 6721ip common area phone  <br/> Aastra 6725ip desk phone  <br/> HP 4110 IP Phone (common area phone)  <br/> HP 4120 IP Phone (desk phone)  <br/> Polycom CX500 IP common area phone  <br/> Polycom CX600 IP desk phone  <br/> Polycom CX700 IP desk phone  <br/> Polycom CX3000 IP conference phone  <br/> |67/68  <br/> |DHCP  <br/> |Used by the listed devices to find the Skype for Business Server certificate, provisioning FQDN, and Registrar FQDN.  <br/> |
   
\* To configure specific ports for these media types, use the CsConferencingConfiguration cmdlet (ClientMediaPortRangeEnabled, ClientMediaPort, and ClientMediaPortRange parameters).
  
> [!NOTE]
> The setup programs for Skype for Business clients automatically create the required operating-system firewall exceptions on the client computer. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> The ports that are used for external user access are required for any scenario in which the client must traverse the organization's firewall (for example, any external communications or meetings hosted by other organizations). 
  
## IPsec exceptions

For enterprise networks where Internet Protocol security (IPsec) (see IETF RFC 4301-4309) has been deployed, IPsec must be disabled over the range of ports used for the delivery of audio, video, and panoramic video. The recommendation is motivated by the need to avoid any delay in the allocation of media ports due to IPsec negotiation.
  
The following table explains the recommended IPsec exception settings. 
  
**Recommended IPsec Exceptions**
