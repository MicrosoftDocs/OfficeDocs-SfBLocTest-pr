## Hardware

Refer to the Office 365 [System requirements](https://products.office.com/en-us/office-system-requirements) for the hardware required to run the Skype for Business client.
  
## Skype for Business Web App Browsers

Skype for Business Web App supports specific combinations of operating systems and browsers. For details, see [Plan for Meetings clients (Web App and Meetings App)](meetings-clients.md). 
  
## Microsoft Office Supportability

Skype for Business Server 2015 clients support integration with various versions of Microsoft Office.
  
- Skype for Business integration features are supported on Outlook 2016, Outlook 2013, and Outlook 2010.
    
- Skype for Business integration features are supported on Microsoft Exchange Server 2016, Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, and Microsoft Exchange Server 2010.
    
- The Online Meeting Add-in for Skype for Business is supported with Office 2016, Office 2013, and Microsoft Office 2010.
    
## Using Mandatory Profiles

If you plan to use the Skype for Business conferencing features, avoid using Active Directory Domain Services mandatory profiles to sign in to the Skype for Business client. Because mandatory profiles are read-only user profiles, the public key infrastructure (PKI) keys that are required for Skype for Business conferencing cannot be saved to the profile. 
  
## Macintosh Operating Systems

The Skype for Business on Mac support requirements are detailed in [Skype for Business on Mac client requirements](mac-requirements.md).
