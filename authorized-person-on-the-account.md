# Authorized person on the account

In the **New Local Number Port Order** wizard, you must enter the name of the person that is authorized to make changes to the account with the service provider or carrier. The name isn't used to process the port order, but is used in the case of a dispute, or if something is incorrect when numbers are ported. This person will be accountable for the Letter of Authorization (LOA) for a port order.
  
    
    


> [!NOTE]
> Not having the complete name, because the box is limited to 15 characters (including spaces), won't delay or cancel the port order.
